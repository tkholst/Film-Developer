I would like to add a startup menu where I can select "Run manually" with start/stop button, or read predefined processing times from text files from a micro sd card. It would also be nice to select text files from different folders on the sd card, if possible.
The countdown timer should change every second, as for now I have only managed to make it change every time the motor changes direction, that is every 5 seconds. I should use an interrupt here, but have not yet realized how to do it.
Also, when running in "manual mode", the timer should count from zero and up from every start.
